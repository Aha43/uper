**Requirement and Implementation Plan (RIP)**

**Phase One: Authentication Module**

---

### **Objective**

Implement user authentication using Auth0, including support for Google and OAuth/OpenID providers, session handling, and secure token storage. Provide a reusable Flutter module and an example app to demonstrate authentication functionality.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. Auth0 setup and configuration.  
2. Flutter module for authentication.  
3. Example app demonstrating login/logout functionality and user data retrieval.

---

### **Features**

1. **Auth0 Setup:**

   * Create an Auth0 account and tenant.  
   * Configure applications and connections for:  
     * Google authentication.  
     * OAuth/OpenID providers.  
2. **Authentication Flow:**

   * **Login and Logout:**  
     * Build UI for login screen with options for Google and other OAuth providers.  
     * Implement logout functionality.  
   * **Session Management:**  
     * Handle user sessions securely.  
     * Implement token storage and refresh mechanisms.  
3. **Reusable Flutter Module:**

   * Encapsulate authentication logic in a module.  
   * Provide APIs for login, logout, and retrieving user data.  
4. **Example App:**

   * Build a simple Flutter app to demonstrate the login flow and display authenticated user details.

---

### **Dependencies**

1. **Auth0 SDK:** For integrating Auth0 in Flutter.  
2. **Secure Storage Library:** For securely storing tokens (e.g., `flutter_secure_storage`).  
3. **HTTP Client Library:** For making API calls (e.g., `http` or `dio`).

---

### **Development Steps**

1. **Auth0 Configuration:**

   * Sign up for Auth0 and create a tenant.  
   * Configure a new application (Native type for Flutter).  
   * Set up connections for Google and OAuth providers.  
   * Obtain client ID and domain for integration.  
2. **Authentication Implementation:**

   * Use Auth0 SDK to integrate login/logout functionality.  
   * Design a login screen with provider buttons (Google, etc.).  
   * Securely handle tokens:  
     * Store access and refresh tokens in `flutter_secure_storage`.  
     * Implement token refresh logic using Auth0 APIs.  
3. **Flutter Module:**

   * Create a reusable Dart library to abstract Auth0 integration.  
   * Include methods for:  
     * Login/logout.  
     * Retrieving user profile data.  
     * Handling session persistence.  
4. **Example App:**

   * Develop a minimal app showcasing login/logout and displaying user profile data.  
   * Test the complete flow end-to-end.  
5. **Testing and Documentation:**

   * Write unit tests for key functionality.  
   * Document setup steps and library usage with code examples.

---

### **Timeline**

1. Auth0 setup and provider configuration: **1 day**.  
2. Authentication flow implementation: **3 days**.  
3. Example app development: **1 day**.  
4. Documentation and testing: **2 days**.  
* **Total:** \~1 week.

---

### **Risks and Mitigation**

1. **Auth0 Rate Limits:**

   * Mitigation: Monitor requests during testing and optimize API usage.  
2. **Token Security:**

   * Mitigation: Use secure storage libraries and follow Auth0 best practices.  
3. **Learning Curve:**

   * Mitigation: Leverage Auth0â€™s documentation and sample apps for reference.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. Approve this RIP.  
2. Set up the Auth0 environment.  
3. Begin development of the authentication flow.
