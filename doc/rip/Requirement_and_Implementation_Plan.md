**Requirement and Implementation Plan (RIP)**

**Project Title:** General-Purpose User Persistent Client Library

---

### **Objective**

Develop a user-persistent client library, initially for Flutter/Dart, leveraging emerging cloud services like Turso and Fly.io with Auth0 for authentication. The library will be extensible for cross-platform use in the future.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **User Authentication:**  
   * Google authentication.  
   * General authority service integration using OAuth/OpenID.  
   * Secure authorization through Auth0.  
2. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**  
   * APIs to store and retrieve plain DTO objects tied to authenticated users.  
   * Integration with Turso for database needs.  
3. **Edge Deployment:**  
   * Fly.io for hosting backend API and facilitating edge-focused architecture.  
4. **Developer Experience:**  
   * Modular and well-documented library design.  
   * Focus on simplicity and ease of integration.

---

### **Technology Stack**

1. **Backend Database:** Turso  
2. **Backend Hosting:** Fly.io  
3. **Authentication:** Auth0  
4. **Frontend Framework:** Flutter/Dart  
5. **Communication:** RESTful API or gRPC (to be decided based on performance needs)
