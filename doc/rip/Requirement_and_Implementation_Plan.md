**Requirement and Implementation Plan (RIP)**

**Project Title:** General-Purpose User Persistent Client Library (UPER)

---

### **Objective**

Develop a user-persistent client library, initially for Flutter/Dart, leveraging emerging cloud services like Turso and Fly.io with Auth0 for authentication. The library will be extensible for cross-platform use in the future. It will include onboarding functionality to guide new users and provide basic free functionality while supporting future infrastructure for feature access control based on user plans.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **User Authentication:**

   * Google authentication.  
   * General authority service integration using OAuth/OpenID.  
   * Secure authorization through Auth0.  
2. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**

   * APIs to store and retrieve plain DTO objects tied to authenticated users.  
   * Integration with Turso for database needs.  
3. **User Onboarding:**

   * Enable apps to guide new users through setup and feature discovery.  
   * Maintain an onboarding status flag for each user.  
   * Integrate onboarding metadata into Auth0 profiles.  
4. **Feature Access Control (Future-Oriented):**

   * Support a model where users can install apps with basic free functionality.  
   * Include infrastructure to enable access control based on user plans in future versions.  
   * Consider plans as claims in access/identity tokens to facilitate scalable authorization logic.  
5. **Edge Deployment:**

   * Fly.io for hosting backend API and facilitating edge-focused architecture.  
6. **Developer Experience:**

   * Modular and well-documented library design.  
   * Focus on simplicity and ease of integration.

### **Technology Stack**

1. **Backend Database:** Turso  
2. **Backend Hosting:** Fly.io  
3. **Authentication:** Auth0  
4. **Frontend Framework:** Flutter/Dart  
5. **Communication:** RESTful API or gRPC (to be decided based on performance needs)
